Streams in Linux are treated as though they were files.
0 - represents std in, is the standard input stream

1 - presents std out. Text output from the command to the shell is delivered via the stdout (standard out) stream
    To explicitly redirect  stdout, use 1>

2 - presents std error. To explicitly redirect  stderr, use 2>


# Sends both successful and un-successful  output to screen
ls

# Sends successful output to /dev/null
ls 1> /dev/null

# Sends error output to /dev/null
ls 2> /dev/null

# Send both std output and error to a file
ls &> file.txt
./error.sh > capture.txt 2>&1

# Send std output and std error to separate files
cd /etc
find .  1>~/find_success.txt 2>~/find_fail.txt

# Send output to two files
echo "abc">>success.txt >>fail.txt

# Detect redirection within script
if [ -t 0 ]; then
  echo "stdin from keyboard"
else
  echo "stdin from a pipe or file"
