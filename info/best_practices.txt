Storage
- script files are stored in "/usr/local/bin"

Permissions
- Prevent users from modifying the script, and make sure to require root permissions to do so
- Script is owned by the group and user
sudo chown root:root <Scriptfilename>

Extension
- File extension is NOT required in Linuz at all, hence script files without .sh is acceptable
- without extensions script files are interpeted with the shebang (#!/bin/bash)
